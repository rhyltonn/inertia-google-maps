# inertia-google-maps

> Google Map integration for VueJs + Inertia

## Demo
I made an adaptation for something very specific that I need, follow the link of the original application:
https://github.com/maxal-studio/vuejs3-google-maps



You can clone this directory and run the command below to generate a demo Vue 3 project using this plugin!
```
npm run serve:demo
```

## Description
This plugin integrates google places into your vue3 application. It uses browser geolocation to track the user. You will have to provide a default fallback address and lat,lng in case the plugin fails to find the user's location. Once the location is found the map is centered and a Marker is placed on the map. The user can search for a different location, move the marker by dragging or clicking.

## Events
1. Search - User can search by query for any kind of address
2. Map clicking - Once a click is triggered on the map, the plugin will try to find the nearest road, business, city.
3. Dragging - Dragging will not trigger any Map API events, it will only update the users latitude and longitude

## Callbacks
1. On each map data change the plugin will return back a list of computed data:

```js
{
  address_description: "Global Records Albania, Rruga Frederik Shiroka 3, Tiranë, Albania"
  city: "Tiranë"
  country: "Albania"
  lat: 41.327455
  lng: 19.80484
  place: Proxy {address_components: Array(6), formatted_address: "Rruga Frederik Shiroka 3, Tiranë, Albania", geometry: {…}, name: "Global Records Albania", html_attributions: Array(0), …} //Google Maps API place object
  query: ""
  state: "Qarku i Tiranës"
  zip_code: "1001" //Sometime comes as null
}
```
   
## Installation

```
npm i inertia-google-maps
```

## Dependencies

This plugin uses geolocation to track users location so **vue3-geolocation** plugin should be installed to:
```
npm i vue3-geolocation
```

## Usage

Before starting you need a Google API key from the [developer console](http://console.developers.google.com/), once you obtained your key, import the module in your application and register it as plugin:

### Needed Google APIS

1. Maps Javascript API
2. Places API
3. GeoCoding API

```js
import VueGeolocation from "vue3-geolocation";
import GMaps from "vuejs3-google-maps";

let app = createApp(App);

app.use(VueGeolocation);
app.use(GMaps, {
  load: {
    apiKey: "your-api-key",
    libraries: ["places"],
  },
});

app.mount("#app");
```

## Components

```html
<PlaceSearch
  v-bind:verConsole="verConsole"
  v-bind:ready="ready"
  placeholder="Enter a location"
  loading="Map is loading"
  v-bind:fallbackProcedure="fallbackProcedure"
  v-bind:zoom="zoom"
  v-bind:geolocation="geolocation"
  v-bind:gps_timeout="3000"
  v-bind:address="address"
  @changed="getMapData"
>
</PlaceSearch>
```

```js
export default {
  name: "AddressesCreate",
  data() {
    return {
      verConsole: false,
      ready: true, //Add ready:false to stop map from loading, and then when changed to true map will auto load
      // **GPS** : will trigger geolocation plugin , to find users location by GPS
      // **geolocation** : will try to find the place by lat, lng
      // **address**: will try to find the place by address query
      // **manually**: manually preset values

      // If GPS is selected as a fallbackProcedure and it fails , then address fallback is triggered and if address fails geolocation is triggered
      fallbackProcedure: "geolocation", //gps | geolocation | address | manually
      zoom: 17, //Default Zoom
      geolocation: {
        // If GPS and Find by address fails then, map will be positioned by a default geolocation
        lat: 31.73858,
        lng: -35.98628,
        zoom: 2,
      },
      address: {
        query: "Brazil, Rio de Janeiro", //If GPS fails, Find by address is triggered
        zoom: 10,
      },
      manually: {
        address_description: "21 Dhjetori, Tirana, Albania",
        city: "Tirana",
        country: "Albania",
        lat: 41.3267905,
        lng: 19.8060475,
        state: "Tirana County",
        zip_code: "",
        zoom: 17,
      },
      place: {},

      t_lat: "",
      t_lng: "",
    };
  },
  methods: {
    getMapData(place) {
      this.place = place;
    },
  },
  created() {},
};
```
